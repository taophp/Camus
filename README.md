Camus is a conceptual programming language designed to make **intention and responsibility explicit**. AIs write the code, but humans review, validate, and take responsibility before compilation. The compilation process is deterministic, producing executable programs for existing ecosystems.

## Philosophy

Camus is guided by a single principle: **every program is a deliberate act**.

Key ideas:

- **Intention first**: Every function, module, or block should have a clearly defined purpose.  
- **Human responsibility**: AI may generate code, but humans are accountable for reviewing and approving it.  
- **Transparent execution**: Compilation produces deterministic code; AI is never involved in execution.  
- **Traceable structure**: Programs are structured for readability, auditability, and accountability.

This is **an early-stage project**, exploring how programming can align human and AI collaboration with clarity and responsibility.

## Roadmap

1. Refine syntax and core abstractions  
2. Define formal model for intention and responsibility  
3. Explore transcompilation to existing languages  
4. Gradually prototype execution and validation tools
