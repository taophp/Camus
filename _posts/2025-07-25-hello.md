Welcome to the official Camus blog! We're excited to launch this space where we'll share updates, insights, and developments about the Camus project.

## What to Expect

This blog will be your go-to source for:

- **Project Updates**: Latest features, design decisions, and releases
- **Community Highlights**: Showcasing how developers and researchers are experimenting with Camus
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Behind-the-scenes looks at Camus's design and implementation
- **Usage & Design Tips**: Guidance for writing clear intentions and constraints
- **Announcements**: Important news and upcoming events

## Our Journey So Far

Camus grew from the need to make intent and responsibility explicit in code. Instead of hiding purpose in implementation details, Camus encourages capturing a function's intention and constraints as first-class artifacts. We're exploring language design, verification, and deterministic compilation to existing ecosystems.

```camus
// Greetings from the Camus team
// This illustrative snippet documents intent for human review
function Hello() -> Void
  intention "Welcome readers to the Camus blog"
  constraints {
    input {}
    output {}
  }
  {
    // Intention and constraints are explicit and reviewable
  }
```

## What's Coming Next

We have exciting developments on the horizon:

- Parsers and validators for intentions and constraints
- Community showcase featuring real-world Camus usage and prototype tools
